                            powered solely by the energy of a standard-sized mousetrap. The car traveled an impressive
                            distance of 23 meters, demonstrating the effective conversion of potential energy into
                            kinetic energy. This project involved understanding and applying principles of physics, such
                            as energy transfer and friction reduction, to maximize the car's performance.</p>

                            as possible. My bridge held approximately 2.7 pounds per ounce, showcasing its
                            strength-to-weight ratio. This project required careful planning and execution to ensure the
                            bridge met all specifications and performed well under load testing.</p>
